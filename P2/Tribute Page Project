            <h2>Here's the timeline of Cascading Style Sheets:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><em>1994</em> - HÃ¥kon Wium Lie proposes the idea of CSS while working at CERN alongside Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web.
                    He publishes the first draft of Cascading HTML Style Sheets proposal.</li>
                <li><em>1996</em> - The first version of CSS known as CSS1, is released by the World-Wide Consortium (W3C). It defines basic properties for fonts, colors. margins, and text alignment.</li>
                <li><em>1998</em> - CSS2 is released by the W3C, adding new features such as
                    positioning, media types, pseudo-elements. Work on CSS3 begins shortly after.</li>
                <li><em>2005</em> - The W3C decides to split CSS3 into separate modules include
                    Selectors, Box Model, Backgrounds and Borders, Text Effects, 2D/3D Transformations, Animations, and Grid Layout.</li>
                <li><em>2016</em> - CSS2.1 becomes an official W3C Recommendation, meaning it has
                    been reviewed and approved by the W3C members. It fixes some errors and ambiguities in CSS2 and adds some new features such as inline-block and table-layout.</li>
                <li><em>2018</em> - The first level of CSS Grid Layout becomes a W3C Recommendation, providing a powerful way to create two-dimensional layouts for web pages.
                    It is widely supported by modern browsers.</li>
                <li><em>2020</em> - The W3C publishes the first working draft of CSS4 which is not a single specification but a collection of new modules and extensions to existing ones.
                    Some of the proposed features include color-mod(), custom media queries, nesting rules, and :is() and :where() pseudo-classes.</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote cite="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/10/why-is-css-so-weird/">
                "CSS is the design language of the web - one of the three core web languages - but it also seems to be the most contentious and often perplexing. It's too easy and too hard, too fragile and too resilient. Love it or hate it
                , CSS is weird: not quite markup, not quite programming in the imperative sense, and nothing like the design programs we use for print. How did we get here?" -- Miriam Suzanne
